This section of the guide covers all of the commands discussed so far at a glance to quickly reference them. If you need detailed information on any of the commands, you should refer to the respective sections in the guide.

### Configuration

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "
```

### Repository Initialization

```bash
git init
```

### Cloning a Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Staging Changes

```bash
git add <file-name> # stage a specific file
git add . # stage all files
```

### Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### Viewing Changes

```bash
git status # view the status of the repository
git diff # view changes in the working directory
```

### Branching

```bash
git branch # list all branches and highlight the current branch
git branch <branch-name> # create a new branch
git checkout <branch-name> # switch to a branch
git checkout -b <branch-name> # create and switch to a new branch
git checkout - # switch to the last branch
git merge <branch-name> # merge a branch into the current branch
git branch -d <branch-name> # delete a branch (use -D to force delete)
```

### Remote Repository

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url> # add a remote repository
git remote -v # view remote repositories
git push -u origin master # push changes to a remote repository
git pull origin master # pull changes from a remote repository
git remote delete origin # remove a remote repository
```

In the above commands "origin" is referred to as the remote repository. You can name it anything you want. It is a convention to name it "origin. you can view the remote URL of the repository using the following command:

```bash
git remote -v
```

It will show you the remote URL of the repository along with the name of the remote repository.

```bash
mahesh@Maheshs-MacBook-Air-M1-3 docs % git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/maheshmnj/docs.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/maheshmnj/docs.git (push)
```

### Tagging

```bash
git tag # list all tags
git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Tag message" # create an annotated tag
git push origin <tag-name> # push a tag to a remote repository
git push origin --tags # push all tags to a remote repository
```

### Stashing

```bash
git stash # stash changes
git stash list # list all stashes
git stash show # show the latest stash
git stash pop # apply and drop the latest stash
git stash apply # apply the latest stash
git stash apply stash@{n} # apply a specific stash
git stash drop # drop the latest stash
git stash drop stash@{n} # drop a specific stash
```

when you clone a repository remote will be set by default to the URL you cloned from.

### Checkout a Pull Request

Although most of the answers on this thread work, I prefer to fetch a  pull request in a new branch and do a soft reset to an old commit (moves the PR changes to the staging area), this allows me to test the PR changes as well as see the difference in my IDE.

```
git fetch origin pull/<PR-id>/head:<BRANCH_NAME>
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
and then do a soft reset to a old commit (see list of commits using `git log`)

```
git reset --soft <hash_of_old_commit>
```

e.g 

```shell
git fetch origin pull/65/head:test-branch 
git checkout test-branch
git log # press 'q' to exit
git reset --soft 7d7fe166cd878ed70c559c4e98faf2323532
```

Running the above command will pull the changes of the PR and show them in your IDE version and they won't be committed and you can see the difference in your staging area (as if those changes were made locally.)
