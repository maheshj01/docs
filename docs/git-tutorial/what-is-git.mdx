[from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

It is a version control tool that helps you access different versions of a file at any point in time. Git comes with built-in GUI tools (git-gui, gitk), but there are several [third-party tools](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) for users looking for a platform-specific experience. If you are only a beginner, I would recommend using git from the command line before using any of the GUI tools at this time, until you understand the basics of git. There are different types of version control tools such as git, stash, source code, etc and git is the most popular used. Git was developed by the Legendary [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds?tab=overview&from=2023-11-01&to=2023-11-04), the same guy who created Linux.

### Who should learn git?

No matter what role you are working in tech, Whether you are a student, Freelancer, Open Source contributor, Volunteer, project manager, or someone who has just started to learn to write code. If you deal with writing code, you must know git. Even if you have never heard about it, in this guide I will share everything I have ever learned about git. Throughout my career, I have been making a note of all the git commands in this github gist But perhaps it really won't make sense to you unless you know how git works. This is the entire thing, I have ever learned to get away with 99% of the problems related to git. The remaining 1% is merely a learning for a lifetime. Rest assured I will continue to update this guide as I learn.

### Why should I learn git?

I have seen people saving different versions of releases by date in different folders on their local computer, on Google Drive, but won't use git. It is like fighting the system to get the job done. The argument I hear is that it is difficult to learn, I need to buy a course on git, and I am a solo developer working on a project why would I need git? If you agree with that argument it simply means you don't understand git and don't fully utilize the resources available to learn.
Let me give simple instances of why you would need it,

- Imagine you are working on a project and 
  Your hard disk crashes (for whatever reason)
- Your computer dies of power.
- You accidentally deleted a file
- Fixed a bug but silently broke a feature.

and the most common one "My code worked yesterday"

Now that you exactly know why you need git, let's get started with the basics of git.
