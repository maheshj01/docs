I have often come across questions from folks when they run into a problem such as, I accidentally deleted a file, pushed a secret to Github, merged a wrong branch, deleted a local branch, and tonnes of questions, and I have experienced these situations myself day in and day out. I always wanted to write a comprehensive guide that acts as a knowledge base that I can refer to at any point in my career. I hope this is that guide that will end all your git questions and help you git away with any git-related problems(Pun intended).

If you are someone who is familiar with git and looking for a quick reference guide, you can jump to the [Git Commands](/docs/git-commands) section which has all the git commands that you will ever need.
